= INSTALL_EXTRAS =

This file installs configuration files and documentation for a [[Spell|spell]]. It stops [[installwatch]] as well.

Configuration files include:
* {{{xinetd.d}}} directory
* {{{init.d}}} directory
* {{{pam.d}}} directory
* {{{desktop}}} directory

**Warning:** when [[Stage|staging]] is used, keep in mind that destination folders/files must not conflict with those from the [[Spell/Files/INSTALL|INSTALL]] phase, otherwise they will be discarded.
